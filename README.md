# Get Microsoft GDAP under control before May 22nd

## Overview
Granular Delegated Admin Permissions (GDAP) allows partners to access customer workloads in a more granular and time-bound manner, addressing customer security concerns and also helps customers who have regulatory requirements for least-privileged access to partners. Partners with Admin agent role can request GDAP relationship, have a maximum duration of two years and cannot be made permanent for security reasons.

In the current business landscape, many Managed Service Providers (MSPs) often retain administrative access to their customers' Global Admin (GA) accounts. It's paramount to adapt to evolving industry standards and showcase the exceptional value of your services as a CSP Partner. Security is key in gaining customer trust and confidence.

## How to use
1. [Download](https://github.com/cloudfactorydk/GDAPMigrationTool/releases) the GDAP Migration tool and run it.
2. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 GA Partner Account when prompted (Browser opens).
3. Please don't close the browser and don't close the tool.

## Hypotheses
1. The implementation of granular delegated admin permissions (GDAP) in partner-customer relationships will result in improved customer satisfaction, increased security, and enhanced partner performance.
2. The next generation of MSPs, who prioritize security-first approaches and possess cloud-native expertise, will gain a competitive edge over traditional Microsoft partners who rely on shared Global Admin (GA) access, leading to greater customer acquisition and retention.
3. By offering valuable consulting and services focused on security, MSPs can effectively demonstrate their expertise and differentiate themselves in the market, leading to increased customer engagement and higher revenue generation.
